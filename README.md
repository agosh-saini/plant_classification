# Plant Classification
Name: Agosh Saini
Website: agoshsaini.com

# Objective
The objective of this project is to train a model that can be used for classification of plants from images. This project was used because I am really into foraging and this would be a good tool to verify plants before consumption.

The breakdown of the code can be found in the jupiter notebook (.ipynb) file with the trained model being found in flower_classifier.pth
